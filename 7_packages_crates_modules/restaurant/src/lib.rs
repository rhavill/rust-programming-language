// These two use statements we had in Listing 2-4 in the Guessing Game bring 
// items from std into scope:
// use std::cmp::Ordering;
// use std::io;
// Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one 
// line: 
// use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};

// We can also replace these two use statements:
// use std::io;
// use std::io::Write;
// With this use statement:
// use std::io::{self, Write};

// If we want to bring all public items defined in a path into scope, we can 
// specify that path followed by *, the glob operator:
// use std::collections::*;
